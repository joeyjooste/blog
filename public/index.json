[{"content":"The OODA loop is a decision-making framework developed by military strategist John Boyd. It stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.\nObserve The first step, gather information from your environment. Whether that\u0026rsquo;s physical or related to a problem you are having. You have to start by gathering all the information you can.\nOrient Analyse it. Mentally process all the information and position yourself in the context of the information. How does it affect you? What implications does X, Y and Z have on you? What happens if X does Y to Z?\nDecide Now you know what\u0026rsquo;s happening, it\u0026rsquo;s time to pick a course of action based on the analysis. Weigh the options up. Option A is better than option B. So you pick option A.\nAct Then finally implement your choice of action. Act out on it, its the best option you have right now, so you might as well execute it to the best of your ability.\nIterate This is where the magic happens, you want to be repeating this cycle as fast as possible. When you receive new information you want to observe it on the next cycle. You should be able to complete this whole cycle in 5 seconds. You should aim to observe then instantly orient, then make a quick decision and act on it. The faster you iterate the more you can achieve.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/oodaloop/","summary":"The OODA loop is a decision-making framework developed by military strategist John Boyd.

I made the mistake today of not researching a market well enough before entering it. Specifically not researching the market in my country.\nWhat happened I made the decision at my company to target boxing gyms with our product offering. The issue with this, is that in the UK boxing gyms are more like clubs, that have sponsors and receive donations, unlike the US where boxing gyms are businesses which you can sell too. When doing market research I looked at statistics like the number of boxing gyms in the UK, which are misleading. Because in the UK boxing works differently to the US, for instance, the gyms in the UK are a lot smaller than the US, they operate as charitys rather than businesses.\nThis causes a huge issue if you are now trying to sell your premium product offering to them and not a single person you cold call has any money for it.\nPivoting Small startups in the service space have one massive advantage over larger corporations. We can pivot at a moments notice. Chaning our product offering to a different niche is as easy as changing 6 words in the cold call script and adjusting your presentation for the sales calls. A short conversation with the development team later, and that\u0026rsquo;s it. Now you are working a whole new niche.\nThe sunk cost fallacy The sunk cost fallacy refers to the misconception where people continue investing in a project, venture, or decision based on the cumulative prior investment (time, money, resources) despite the future costs outweighing the potential benefits.\nThis is a massive issue in companies. People struggle with this because 9/10 times it means having to own up to a mistake you made or a lapse in judgement. But for the company it\u0026rsquo;s 100x better that you identify a project as being a failure before wasting countless hours, time and effort in order to complete something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer much benefit.\nSummary Identify the mistake, own up to the mistake, and make the best decision in the situation. Pivot if you can, adjust to avoid downsides if you can\u0026rsquo;t. Just don\u0026rsquo;t sink money into something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t yeald any future benefit.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/the-importance-of-market-research/","summary":"Introduction Market Research\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound very interesting, yet it\u0026rsquo;s increasingly important.

Everyone struggles at first. If I listen back to the cold calls in a years time, or even a few weeks time, I will cringe at the sound of me failing so badly. You have to get through the first 100 before you become any good at it. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing at around 100 cold calls I\u0026rsquo;ll be miles better than I am currently, that\u0026rsquo;s the hope atleast.\nPutting it off A lot of people keep putting it off, they say things like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m gonna start playing guitar one day\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Maybe one day I\u0026rsquo;ll have the time to go to the gym\u0026rdquo;.

You don\u0026rsquo;t have time? Take a quick look at your phone screen time, the gym only takes 45 minutes, practicing an instrument or learning a language only takes 30 minutes.

GO AND DO IT.\nMy Experience I suffer from a horrible case of ADHD, people tell me I have it, I like to think about it differently, what if I can prove them wrong, what if I stop leaving it to the last minute and just get up and do it now, what would their reaction be to seeing it just be done, instead of knowing to expect failure from me, what if I actually produced work and did what I said I was going to do. I often leave things to the last minute, knowing I can become \u0026ldquo;disaster recovery Joey\u0026rdquo; and then fix all the mess when it happens, i can come up with a good enough excuse, or make up some lie, but I\u0026rsquo;ve got to actively stop myself, catch myself watching youtube, and do the work.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Simple It\u0026rsquo;s simple for me, all it takes for me to be able to work is for me to identify that I\u0026rsquo;m putting it off, then it becomes easy. I think of why I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do it, then do that first, I think of the disaster that\u0026rsquo;s gonna happen at the end, then I sit down and I do it, I catch myself doing anything fun or any sort of procratsinating when the thing isn\u0026rsquo;t done yet? I stop myself, I sit down and I do it.

It has been the best experience that I\u0026rsquo;ve had while using a computer.\nAnd its not even close.\nThe beginnings Growing up I played a lot of video games, so naturally I gravitated towards windows. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of money. This combination meant I was using windows and always attempting to squeeze the most performance possible out of it. I learnt the ins and outs of windows. Everything from the basics of removing animations, all the way to advanced overclocking and registry tweaking.\nThe issue One issue I was constantly running into on windows was how slow and sluggish it was. This was mainly due to all the bad decisions that microsoft was making, and so my linux journey began.\nFirst install The very first time I installed Linux, I installed Manjaro. Yes, I know what you are thinking, what a horrible idea that was. You would be correct in thinking like that. Coming from windows, I had no idea how to even use the command line. I did everything wrong, and so as expected, nothing worked.\nThe loop So of course, I uninstalled Manjaro and went back to windows. This same process repeated itself with a number of distros over the past 4 years. Every distro from, Ubuntu, to Mint, and even NixOS. None of them worked, time after time I reverted back to windows.\nArch Installation Finally I decided to bite the bullet I had been trying to avoid for so long, I installed Arch. I knew if I installed Arch, the only way it would work is if I did everything correctly. Which meant using a tiling window manager, using VIM, and managing dotfiles correctly. This was a daunting task, as I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to invest the time in to learn everything. But about a month ago, I decided to do it. The arch install process went very smoohtly. I used the Arch install script, I know what you are thinking,\n\u0026ldquo;He should have used the wiki\u0026rdquo;.\nI now realise that I should have used the wiki.\nI understand a large amount about linux now, as I have been using it on and off for nearly 4 years. So I am not too concerned about the issue that arise from using the install script, I have adopted the \u0026ldquo;fix it yourself\u0026rdquo; mentality that Arch so heavily insists upon. In addition I am a programmer so I know how to read error messages etc. So fixing my way through issues is something that is so easy with the use of the wiki.\nWhat should I use? The next question was what window manager to use. I decided to use Wayland rather than X, because I have been frustrated with X in the past and wanted to try something new. A lot of waylands features look really useful. So I installed wayland, and as my compositor I went with Hyprland.\nThis was a super easy install process as I used the dot files from HyprDots to allow me to get some dotfiles that look half decent. This gave me time to learn a window manager, as well as using VIM etc.\nMy experience My experience has been nothing short of amazing. A window manager is the way Linux is made to work. It allows me to work way faster than I ever was ever working on windows, after only a month of learning a WM (Compositor in my case due to using Wayland).\nMy recommendation If you are planning a switch to linux, first learn to use BASH or ZSH on your current operation system. You can use WSL on windows if you are coming from a windows background. Then once you know your way around the shell. Give the full window manager Arch experience a shot. It might seem too confusing at first, but very quickly you will get the hang of doing stuff and can get back up to speed working.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/my-first-month-on-arch/","summary":"Introduction I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Arch for about a month now.
