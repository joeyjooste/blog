# Consistency = Winning

I'm chronically ADHD. Staying consistent has always been one of the hardest things for me to do. I find it nearly impossible to build habits that last. The second I miss a single day of any habit I fall apart.

The solution to building habits, that last for me, has been one thing. Only trying to build 1 habit at a time. The constant mistake I was making was trying to change too many things at the same time.

"I accumulated small but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable when I started." - James Clear

I took advice like this, and tried to build too many habits at the same time, none of them stuck. Until I tried only focusing on a single habit, and continuously doing so until I don't consciously think about the habit. Then it's time for a new habit.
