[{"content":"Introduction One day or day one\u0026hellip;\nOne of my favourite motivational quotes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s extremely cliche, but it\u0026rsquo;s true, it applies to nearly all things you want to start.\nToday I did my first 6 proper cold calls.\nI had been putting if off for a long time and today was the day I finally decided to do it properly.\nYou are going to be awful You are going to suck, its your first day, no one is a master at it on their first day. Everyone struggles at first. If I listen back to the cold calls in a years time, or even a few weeks time, I will cringe at the sound of me failing so badly. You have to get through the first 100 before you become any good at it. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing at around 100 cold calls I\u0026rsquo;ll be miles better than I am currently, that\u0026rsquo;s the hope atleast.\nPutting it off A lot of people keep putting it off, they say things like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m gonna start playing guitar one day\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Maybe one day I\u0026rsquo;ll have the time to go to the gym\u0026rdquo;. This is a horrible habit to get into, because as your life fills up with more stuff, you will inevitably never get around to doing it, what\u0026rsquo;s stopping you from doing it right now? You don\u0026rsquo;t have time? Take a quick look at your phone screen time, the gym only takes 45 minutes, practicing an instrument or learning a language only takes 30 minutes. I guarantee you that you could just use your phone for an hour left and find the time.\nJust do it Nike\u0026rsquo;s old moto, just do it, stop watching the motivational speeches or doing more and more preperation, just do it. Start today, stop reading this blog post, get off your bum, stand up and go and do it. If you are going to do it eventually you might aswell just do it now, if you have time to read this article then just do it. Still reading? GO AND DO IT.\nMy Experience I suffer from a horrible case of ADHD, people tell me I have it, I like to think about it differently, what if I can prove them wrong, what if I stop leaving it to the last minute and just get up and do it now, what would their reaction be to seeing it just be done, instead of knowing to expect failure from me, what if I actually produced work and did what I said I was going to do. I often leave things to the last minute, knowing I can become \u0026ldquo;disaster recovery Joey\u0026rdquo; and then fix all the mess when it happens, i can come up with a good enough excuse, or make up some lie, but I\u0026rsquo;ve got to actively stop myself, catch myself watching youtube, and do the work.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Simple It\u0026rsquo;s simple for me, all it takes for me to be able to work is for me to identify that I\u0026rsquo;m putting it off, then it becomes easy. I think of why I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do it, then do that first, I think of the disaster that\u0026rsquo;s gonna happen at the end, then I sit down and I do it, I catch myself doing anything fun or any sort of procratsinating when the thing isn\u0026rsquo;t done yet? I stop myself, I sit down and I do it. It\u0026rsquo;s hard, but it\u0026rsquo;s the only way that works for me, far simpler said than done.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/one-day-or-day-one/","summary":"Introduction One day or day one\u0026hellip;\nOne of my favourite motivational quotes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s extremely cliche, but it\u0026rsquo;s true, it applies to nearly all things you want to start.\nToday I did my first 6 proper cold calls.\nI had been putting if off for a long time and today was the day I finally decided to do it properly.\nYou are going to be awful You are going to suck, its your first day, no one is a master at it on their first day.","title":"One Day or Day One"},{"content":"Introduction I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Arch for about a month now. It has been the best experience that I\u0026rsquo;ve had while using a computer.\nAnd its not even close.\nThe beginnings Growing up I played a lot of video games, so naturally I gravitated towards windows. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of money. This combination meant I was using windows and always attempting to squeeze the most performance possible out of it. I learnt the ins and outs of windows. Everything from the basics of removing animations, all the way to advanced overclocking and registry tweaking.\nThe issue One issue I was constantly running into on windows was how slow and sluggish it was. This was mainly due to all the bad decisions that microsoft was making, and so my linux journey began.\nFirst install The very first time I installed Linux, I installed Manjaro. Yes, I know what you are thinking, what a horrible idea that was. You would be correct in thinking like that. Coming from windows, I had no idea how to even use the command line. I did everything wrong, and so as expected, nothing worked.\nThe loop So of course, I uninstalled Manjaro and went back to windows. This same process repeated itself with a number of distros over the past 4 years. Every distro from, Ubuntu, to Mint, and even NixOS. None of them worked, time after time I reverted back to windows.\nArch Installation Finally I decided to bite the bullet I had been trying to avoid for so long, I installed Arch. I knew if I installed Arch, the only way it would work is if I did everything correctly. Which meant using a tiling window manager, using VIM, and managing dotfiles correctly. This was a daunting task, as I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to invest the time in to learn everything. But about a month ago, I decided to do it. The arch install process went very smoohtly. I used the Arch install script, I know what you are thinking,\n\u0026ldquo;He should have used the wiki\u0026rdquo;.\nI now realise that I should have used the wiki.\nI understand a large amount about linux now, as I have been using it on and off for nearly 4 years. So I am not too concerned about the issue that arise from using the install script, I have adopted the \u0026ldquo;fix it yourself\u0026rdquo; mentality that Arch so heavily insists upon. In addition I am a programmer so I know how to read error messages etc. So fixing my way through issues is something that is so easy with the use of the wiki.\nWhat should I use? The next question was what window manager to use. I decided to use Wayland rather than X, because I have been frustrated with X in the past and wanted to try something new. A lot of waylands features look really useful. So I installed wayland, and as my compositor I went with Hyprland.\nThis was a super easy install process as I used the dot files from HyprDots to allow me to get some dotfiles that look half decent. This gave me time to learn a window manager, as well as using VIM etc.\nMy experience My experience has been nothing short of amazing. A window manager is the way Linux is made to work. It allows me to work way faster than I ever was ever working on windows, after only a month of learning a WM (Compositor in my case due to using Wayland).\nMy recommendation If you are planning a switch to linux, first learn to use BASH or ZSH on your current operation system. You can use WSL on windows if you are coming from a windows background. Then once you know your way around the shell. Give the full window manager Arch experience a shot. It might seem too confusing at first, but very quickly you will get the hang of doing stuff and can get back up to speed working.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-first-month-on-arch/","summary":"Introduction I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Arch for about a month now.
