## Auth Messiah

An open-source user authentication server that can be setup with cloudflare workers for free in under 15 minutes. 

It's completely free, self-hostable, and solves the issue of authentication for any developer who doesn't want to roll their own auth and doesn't want to pay for a service like Auth0 or Supabase.
